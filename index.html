        <h3>Business (Information Systems) & Informatics (Software Development) <br><br> University of Washington</h3>
        <p> Hello,<br>
            I am from Seattle, WA, and I am currently a freshman at the University of Washington, studying Information Systems at the Foster School of Business, and planning to double in Informatics on a software development track. My passion for technology and business has driven me to pursue a career in both software engineering and product management. <br><br>
            
            What brought me to the University of Washington is the opportunities and chances to meet so many other smart and amazing people. UW has always been one of my dream schools since I was young, and, as the oldest sibling and a first generation student, getting into the school has been a significant accomplishment. <br><br>
            
            What brought me to the Brotherhood initiative was the networking opportunities and resources that BI provided. From workshops to having lunch with the CEO to Mentor Monday's to working with Paul and the whole BI faculty team, BI has delivered many resources, as promised, and some that I didnâ€™t know. <br><br>
            
            The first form of community, though outside of UW, that has significantly shaped my first year is my band at church. They have allowed me to work with such unique talents, and provided me with the opportunity to grow as a musician and learn 3 more instruments this past year. The second gift/form of community that has shaped my first year at UW is reuniting with some old friends and growing deeper connections with friends I had not been too close with. Last but not least, the last gift that has shaped my first year at UW are all the fantastic people I met these past couple of months + more to come!.  <br><br>
