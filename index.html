        <h3>Undergraduate Student | University of Washington</h3>
        <p> Hello,<br>
            I am from Seattle, WA, and I am currently a freshman at the University of Washington, Foster School of Business, majoring in Information Systems and planning to double in Informatics with a software development track. My passion for technology and business has driven me to pursue a career in both software engineering and product management. <br><br>
            
            What brought me to the University of Washington is the opportunities and chances to meet so many other smart and amazing people. UW has always been one of my dream schools since I was young, and being the oldest sibling and first generation getting into the school has been a significant accomplishment. <br><br>
            
            What brought me to the Brotherhood initiative was the networking opportunities and resources that BI provided. From workshops to lunch with the CEO to mentor Monday to Paul, BI has delivered many resources, as promised, and some that I didnâ€™t know. <br><br>
            
            The first form of community, even though it is outside UW, that has shaped my first year is my band at church. They not only allowed me to work with such unique talents but also allowed me to grow as a musician and learn 3 more instruments this past year. The second gift/form of community that has shaped my first year at UW is reuniting with some old friends and growing deeper connections with friends I'm not close with until this year. Last but not least, the last gift that has shaped my first year at UW is all the fantastic people I met this past couple of months. I only wish to grow some closer connections. <br><br>
