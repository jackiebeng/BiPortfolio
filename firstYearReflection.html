                I remember when I first got the invitation to sign up for the Bi around May of 2022, I thought to myself, what even is this? Until I heard some of my high school friends signing up, I thought this might be a great way to meet people and grow connections. Who would’ve thought that the Bi has made such a significant impact on my first year here at UW.<br><br>

                So what does Bi mean to me? Bi means a sense of community for underrepresented men of color at UW. Bi means nothing like its name, which sounds like a frat or Greek life. Bi also means a place to get help to navigate UW as well as opportunities to meet previous cohorts all the way to the CEO of a billion-dollar company. <br><br>

                To me, Bi has honestly made up a good chunk of my first year at UW. I would honestly feel even more lonely if I wasn’t in Bi. Bi has brought me a sense of community and a community full of people of color. Which also seg-ways towards how Bi is important for learning. For starters, I really appreciate the faculty constantly checking in with you to see how you are doing personally and academically. I feel like these small things have a significant impact on learning as you kinda have a sense of someone caring for your academic success. But not only that, but having a support system and a team to go to when you're struggling in any part of UW is nice. I know for sure that when I have problems with my schedule and financial aid, I will be at Paul’s office because he just knows what to do. <br><br>

                What advice would I give to future Bi scholars to make the most out of their Bi experience? Go to events, get to know the faculty as if they are your friends, and chill around at The Brooklyn Trails building; not only will you meet other members, but you also have the chance to hang out with faculty. And don’t be afraid to go to them; the only thing they want from you is to succeed!

                <p>I attended my first ever hackathon hosted by UW called DUBHacks.
                    It was kinda stressful but overall had a lot of fun and experience a lot of new things.
                    Most stressful part was trying to learn a whole new technology / database (Mongo DB) within less then 24 hours which is no way possible.
                    It was also harder as I have not been coding since May 2021 so it was a challenge.
                    This was also the start of my transition from Business going back into tech / software / coding.

                <p>I kinda wanna combine these 2 categories but; part of my first year was also thanks to me living on campus. If I didn't live on campus, I would probably feel even more lonely. Living on campus also gave me the chance to meet a lot of people. 
                    Although I'm not too close with my roomates, they have also made a part of my first year here at UW. We pretty much suffer the harsh reality of first year of college together. <br><br>

                    On the left picture, you can see my dorm set up. I live in Mccarty hall and I made this place that suites my productivity needs. And also some K-pop posters... <br><br>

                    This past academic year has also been a year of growth in my hobbies. I started taking Piano more seriously (Mar, 2022), I started Bass (Dec 2022) and Guitar (Jan 2023). I also started some other hobbies which I will get into later.

                    This year, I also started bouldering again. It's been a very long time since I bouldered so I'll consider it my first.
                    I really enjoy the problem solving aspect of it and it feels really rewarding once you finish a level.

                    Mr. Sinegal was such an amazing guy to talk to and gave us many life and business wisdom. Really great oppertunity to talk to him!

                    In addition to living on campus and dorming, another part of my first year is hanging out with these people after school and classes. It's so nice to just be able to hang out with friends and go to each others dorm, hangout, talk and study together.
                    Seeing your friends work through homework and stuff also pushes you / motivates to work and study hard as well.
                    I'll probably miss this the most when I commute next year.
