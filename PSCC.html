                Currently, I am majoring in Information Systems at the Foster School of Business at UW. However, I also want to major in Informatics with a Software Development track or Computer Science. The reason why I chose these fields is because I’m always been a tech person. I love tech, and I believe tech has improved day-to-day lives by a lot. Funny enough, while doing Running Start, I took some CS classes, and I didn’t really like it then, but I also started to like business. It's not a corporate business, though. So I explored more into business, and I liked that too. So now I see myself working and doing something between those two roles. Either software engineering, technical product management, or even owning a business. <br><br>
                But with any industry, there are bound to be some social problems. A common problem in the tech and business industry is the lack of diversity, racism, and gender discrimination. According to an article by Matt Gonzalez, “More than half of Black workers (54%) say they experience racial bias at work - a significantly higher percentage than for any other racial group.” So, how can my major combat this? I think it is more than just your major; it is also what you take part in and what resources you can take advantage of. For example, I am pretty involved with my church, and I do know that at my church, there are a lot of people who work in the industry, so they can help you get a leg up in the job application process as well as working there. There are also RSOs on campus relating to the thighs I wanna do that I wanna take more part in this year. Hopefully, this will help me be more prepared to face these issues in the industry.

                For this interview, I interviewed Anh (Someone close to your age but not too much older; older brother) Daniel. I chose him because he is considered like an older brother to me. He had helped me with a lot of stuff, from faith to music to career-related topics. He also works at Amazon as a SWE, so he'll know a lot about the issues for this interview. <br><br>
                - Some of the questions I asked were: <br><br>
                - Can you tell me about your work? What are your primary responsibilities and projects? <br><br>
                - Can you describe your career path? How did you come to be doing this work? <br><br>
                - What are some social problems you have observed that are related to your field or line of work? <br><br>
                - What recommendations or solutions have you seen in response to these social problems? Which ones are more promising or successful, in your opinion?<br><br> 

                To briefly talk about the interview, anh Daniel is a SWE at Amazon Web Services. He first majored in Chemical engineering and then switched to BioTech in hopes of pharmacy school. Graduated in that but did not find medicine enjoyable. He returned to school to get a bachelor's in CS and then got an internship, interviews for many companies, and finally got a job as a SWE at AWS. After working at AWS, he noticed that there needs to be more company culture, especially in big tech companies such as Amazon. That may be why these tech companies quickly develop products and services. But that comes with a trade-off of poor work-life balance. That is not all; code one line and chill for the rest of the day, as we all heard on TikTok. He also noticed that there is a culture between American workers and international workers. With the last question of solutions to help with social problems, he said that Amazon employees try to create clubs and social groups similar to RSOs to have a greater sense of community. <br><br>
                <b>"I think that Fostering meaningful relationships in the workplace can aid in team dynamic as well as work-lead stress alleviation."</b><br><br>

                This last line in the interview really struck me. I relate to it because any workplace, including school, church, or work, requires a good team dynamic. Having good team bonding will not only improve performance but also create meaningful long-term relationships.
