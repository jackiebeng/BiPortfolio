            <p data-aos="fade-in">
                Currently, I am majoring in Information Systems at the Foster School of Business at UW. However, I also want to major in Informatics with a Software Development track or Computer Science. The reason why I chose these fields is because I’m always been a tech person. I love tech, and I believe tech has improved day-to-day lives by a lot. Funny enough, while doing Running Start, I took some CS classes, and I didn’t really like it then, but I also started to like business. It's not a corporate business, though. So I explored more into business, and I liked that too. So now I see myself working and doing something between those two roles. Either software engineering, technical product management, or even owning a business. <br><br>
                But with any industry, there are bound to be some social problems. A common problem in the tech and business industry is the lack of diversity, racism, and gender discrimination. According to an article by Matt Gonzalez, “More than half of Black workers (54%) say they experience racial bias at work - a significantly higher percentage than for any other racial group.” So, how can my major combat this? I think it is more than just your major; it is also what you take part in and what resources you can take advantage of. For example, I am pretty involved with my church, and I do know that at my church, there are a lot of people who work in the industry, so they can help you get a leg up in the job application process as well as working there. There are also RSOs on campus relating to the thighs I wanna do that I wanna take more part in this year. Hopefully, this will help me be more prepared to face these issues in the industry.

        <h2 data-aos="slide-up">Revised Personal Statement (December 2022)</h2>
        <div class="PersonalStatement" data-aos="slide-up">
            <p>About 10 weeks later, we are in our last couple weeks of fall quarter, Sophomore year. As I wrap up this quarter, I can’t help but relate to what some SWEs have mentioned. Another problem I didn’t think I said in my statement back in October is work-life balance in the tech industry, as well as imposter syndrome: the need to always catch up to the latest technology. I definitely relate to this as I spend many nights staying up, coding, debugging, and simply catching up with content. That got me thinking: What can I try to do / What do I want to see in the future regarding tech and social positive change? <br><br>
                I want to see a change in diversity (October reflection), but I now want to see better work-life experiences as more social interaction. I also notice people spend more time alone, including coding, so seeing teamwork will foster better team dynamics as well as work environment (Interview Reflection.) This motivates me to not only pursue tech and be a part of a fast and growing industry that helps improve lives, but I want to be able to improve lives that help make other lives better (if that makes sense.)

                For this interview, I interviewed Anh (Someone close to your age but not too much older; older brother) Daniel. I chose him because he is considered like an older brother to me. He had helped me with a lot of stuff, from faith to music to career-related topics. He also works at Amazon as a SWE, so he'll know a lot about the issues for this interview. <br><br>
                - Some of the questions I asked were: <br><br>
                - Can you tell me about your work? What are your primary responsibilities and projects? <br><br>
                - Can you describe your career path? How did you come to be doing this work? <br><br>
                - What are some social problems you have observed that are related to your field or line of work? <br><br>
                - What recommendations or solutions have you seen in response to these social problems? Which ones are more promising or successful, in your opinion?<br><br> 

                To briefly talk about the interview, anh Daniel is a SWE at Amazon Web Services. He first majored in Chemical engineering and then switched to BioTech in hopes of pharmacy school. Graduated in that but did not find medicine enjoyable. He returned to school to get a bachelor's in CS and then got an internship, interviews for many companies, and finally got a job as a SWE at AWS. After working at AWS, he noticed that there needs to be more company culture, especially in big tech companies such as Amazon. That may be why these tech companies quickly develop products and services. But that comes with a trade-off of poor work-life balance. That is not all; code one line and chill for the rest of the day, as we all heard on TikTok. He also noticed that there is a culture between American workers and international workers. With the last question of solutions to help with social problems, he said that Amazon employees try to create clubs and social groups similar to RSOs to have a greater sense of community. <br><br>
                <b>"I think that Fostering meaningful relationships in the workplace can aid in team dynamic as well as work-lead stress alleviation."</b><br><br>

                This last line in the interview really struck me. I relate to it because any workplace, including school, church, or work, requires a good team dynamic. Having good team bonding will not only improve performance but also create meaningful long-term relationships.

                The first professional development thing I did was I  went to the Foster Career Center. Overall, the career is excellent! I worked with Lucas, who has been helping me with my resume and cover letter since last year. This time, I wanted them to review my new experiences and ensure all the layout and keywords were good. I only wish for the Foster Career Center to offer more tech-oriented feedback, but I can't say much since it's a Business school.
                This is useful because there is only so much you can get from chat GPT and online guides; having a real-life person with real experience is always good, too.
                I recommend this service to Foster students and anyone who wants to go into the management route. It was more challenging because I wanted to go towards tech, which they are not geared towards. Yes, they help, but I wish I had access to services like the Allen Career Center. Of, something is better than nothing.
                I still want to work on something geared towards working in tech, such as mock interviews, leet coding, and technical projects.

                The second thing I did for my professional development was more jumping around, but let me explain. The things I did were I did mock interviews, and I tried practicing leet code. I asked Anh Daniel, whom I mentioned previously, for the mock interview to help me with technical interview questions. So, he guided me through the interview process at Amazon and some tips and tricks. Something I took away from this is that the interview process is long, you have to be patient along the way, and you don't have to be too relaxed if you don't get it after all the trial and error. And like I mentioned, I also tried leet coding. From my experience, it was a bit more challenging because I think I am still learning Java in school, so I’m not entirely done. But it gave me an idea of what the technical problems of the interview were like. Yes, it was helpful because the mock interview gave me the perspective of what an actual interview would look like and leet coding.
                I recommend both for students who want to work for big tech. If you have a connection with someone who works in big tech, that would help prepare you for what you might expect.
                Something that I will continue to work on is leet coding.

                The person that we interviewed was Dominique Alexis, the CEO in Mary's place. She is also a UW graduate 2 different times. Initially, we sent out many emails, but one of the first people that got back to us was Mary's place, so we chose them. We chose them because Mary's Place was a local organization in the King County area, and their mission was to ensure no children and pregnant women slept outside. Some of the questions we asked her were: <br><br>

                - What was their mission. <br><br>
                - How do you access the needs of a person. <br><br>
                - What other services do you provide besides shelter. <br><br>
                - How do you collaborate with the government, and have they been any help. <br><br>
                - What is the biggest challenge you are facing right now as Marys place. <br><br>
                - What are some goals moving forward. <br><br>
                
                Too summarize, they said that it can be hard to access the needs of different individuals because everyone comes from a different background. So they take in people as of where they are, meaning as soon as they step in, it starts there regardless of background. Other services they provide are bill assistance and need-based items like hygiene. One of their biggest struggles is seeing where to allocate their services. As we already know, Seattle has some of the most challenging homelessness and housing crises, and it is no exception that these organizations face these problems. She also mentioned that resources can sometimes be so low that it hurts them knowing they can't offer a kid shelter as much as they want. This is really gave me the perspective of what these organizations are facing when it comes to serving and helping communities in this related problem. 
                After taking what we learn, we have a bit more insight on what to do for Spring project. So far, I want to make a YouTube video because filming is one of my personal ways of expressing a message, but that will be discussed with the group.
