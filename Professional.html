                For my Pathway U assessment, the result surprisingly matched my values and ideals, although there were some parts where it didn’t match me too well; overall, it did a  pretty good job. For interest, my primary career interests are ‘Enterprising’ and ‘Conventional.’ For my values, I got ‘Achievement’ and ‘Independence.’ For personality, my highest scores are: ‘Open to Experience,’ ‘Conscientiousness,’ and ‘Honesty.’ Lastly, my workplace preferences are ‘Recognition’ and ‘Collaboration.’ <br><br>

                As I mentioned previously, my results are pretty accurate. Enterprising means go-getter, leading people, decision maker and lead and action-oriented. I often find myself leading group projects and making group decisions a lot which reflected that pretty well. For conventional, it means detailed oriented and procedure. I would say I like a set of guidelines, but I can always work around problems and accommodate when need to.<br><br>

                As I mention in the ‘Missions’ tab, personal growth and achievement are my personal values. Sense of accomplishment is rewarding as you have a sense of accomplishment. Independence: I like to also work at my own pace as well in my own space where I have everything  I need for workflow.<br><br>

                I’m always open to trying new things. Like this past year, I started snowboarding and rock climbing, and who knows what else to come. Conscientious, my peers also see me as organized and disciplined. The test also reported me as honest. I know people also see me as genuine, but hopefully, that carries to the new people I meet.<br><br>

                Last but not least is workplace preference. I love recognition. Whether recognizing others or getting recognized, it is always nice to hear words of affirmation in and outside the workplace.<br><br>
	
                As someone still uncertain about my career path, these results will help me dive deeper into what I really want to do as a person.
